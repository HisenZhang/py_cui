# py_cui Examples

In this directory you will find a collection of examples of using `py_cui` in several different ways.

* `hello_py_cui.py` - A simple example with just a label
* `simple_todo_list.py` - A simple example of a usable application written with `py_cui`.
* `snano.py` - A simple text editor built with `py_cui` that allows for traversing directories.
* `autogit.py` - A precursor to [pyautogit](https://github.com/jwlodek/pyautogit). Used to do simple git processing in CLI.
* `popups_example.py` - A simple `py_cui` application meant to demonstrate using the popup support.
* `multi_window_demo.py` - A simple application meant to demonstrate support for multiple windows in one application.
* `gaps_between_widgets.py` - A demo on the behavior of py_cui when there are empty grid spaces between widgets
* `control_widgets/*` - A collection of examples demonstrating how to us additional control widgets

If there is another example you would like to see or if you have written one yourself, feel free
to make an [issue](https://github.com/jwlodek/py_cui/issues)!
